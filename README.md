Files in this folder are intended for evaluating carbon capture and utilization 
(CCU) technology attached to existing cellulosic ethanol biorefineries, where
ethanol is as the primary product while methanol as the secondary.
 
system_EtOH_MeOH.py set up the two separate subsystems, where the CCU design, 
including process parameters and unit design are based on
"Design and simulation of a methanol production plant from CO2 hydrogenation"
